What happens when you initialize a repository?

Git creates a .git folder (normally hidden) and creates the initial version of the objects it uses to track changes. That is, it creates the git repository.

Why do you need to do it?

So git can function properly on that particular folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

It contains a logical group of files which should be committed together but has not yet been committed. 

What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets us set up a logical commit group without the commit having to operate on the entire working directory (which may have changes that should not be committed yet.)
