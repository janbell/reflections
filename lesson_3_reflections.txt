When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's a heck of a good idea to have a remote backup for your work, for one thing. In addition, if other people are
working with you, it's the only way to keep the work in sync.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you have other people working on your project, you may not want their changes stomping into your local repository. Otherwise, I'm not sure.
